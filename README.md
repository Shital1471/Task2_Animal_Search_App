# Animal Search App
This Flutter mobile app enables users to search for animal pictures via the Pexels API. Users can input animal names, and the app will display search results in a grid format with seamless pagination. It offers efficient image loading, error handling, and responsive design for a user-friendly experience. To get started, clone the repository, add your Pexels API key, install dependencies, and run the app on your local machine. Feel free to contribute or customize as needed.

## Running the App

Follow these steps to run the Flutter app on your local machine:

### 1. Clone the Repository:

   Clone this repository to your local machine using Git:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name
   ```

### 2. Install Dependencies:

   Make sure you have Flutter installed. If not, you can [install it](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install).

   Next, navigate to the project directory and install the app's dependencies:

   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

### 3. Run the App:

   You can run the app on an emulator or physical device:

   - To run on a connected device or emulator:

     ```bash
     flutter run
     ```

   - To specify a target device, use:

     ```bash
     flutter run -d <device_id>
     ```

   Replace `<device_id>` with the desired device (e.g., `flutter run -d web` for web, `flutter run -d android` for Android).

   The app should now launch on your chosen device or emulator.

### 4. Explore the App:

   Once the app is running, you can explore the user profile UI with various interactive elements and features.



Replace "your-username" and "your-repo-name" with your actual GitHub username and repository name. These instructions will guide users on how to clone, install dependencies, and run the Flutter app on their local environment.
